## About the Lodge
Based on a picturesque setting in a remote mountain location, the lodge is a boutique hotel that was built on the intention to excite each guest into the wonder of nature. Built with cedar wood and nestled in a grove by a healthy creek, the large windows and outdoor access to a sauna invites the attendee to relax and listen to the world around them...

There are 15 rooms with 12 rooms hosting 2-4 guests and 3 suites holding 8 guests.

The database is designed to facilitate smoooth bookings, reservations, and hotel processes to afford the easy-going and relaxing atmosphere of the lodge. 

## SQL Code and ERD Diagram

This project contains the SQL code for the lodging databse and an image of its ERD. Both are located in the db file.

The user interface will be divided into three levels of access: employee, guest, and admin. A single table called userType has been created to integrate this access within the database, allowing certain tables and information to be viewed only by the designated staff. This maintains order and privacy of our information. The database has four main groupings of tables: data related to rooms (dark green), data related to employees (light green), data related to operations (light blue), and even bookings (pink). User type and information is depicted in red in the ERD.
